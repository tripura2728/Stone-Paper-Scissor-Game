# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Game
This is my Stone, Paper; Scissor Game. This project was created as a practice exercise to improve JavaScript skills and understand DOM manipulation, conditional logic, and event handling.


## Technologies Used

HTML:Provides the basic structure and elements of the game interface.
CSS:Styles the HTML elements to make the game visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript: Implements the core game logic, handles user interactions, determines the winner, and updates the scores dynamically in the browser.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the game's structure and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
* style.css: Contains the CSS rules for styling the game elements.
* app.js: Holds the JavaScript code that implements the game's functionality.
* (Optional) `img/`: A directory that might contain image assets used in the game (e.g., icons for stone, paper, scissors).
